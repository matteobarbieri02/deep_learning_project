The Lung Diseases X-Rays (Grayscale) dataset is a collection of grayscale X-Ray images representing various lung diseases, including COVID-19, pneumonia, tuberculosis, along with images of normal lungs.
Images are gathered from various origins and subjected to preprocessing to guarantee consistent size and resolution.
The dataset is specifically designed for the development and exploration of deep learning models focused on classifying lung diseases through the usage of medical imaging. The primary goal is to predict the class to which the X-ray image belongs.
